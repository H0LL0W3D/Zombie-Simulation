<br/>
Simulate zombie "proximity" spread in two dimensional plane made out of arrays. <br/>
<br/>

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ <br/>
 2d matrix initially constructed <br/>
 (optional) initialize with specialized "immunity" spots <br/>
 initialize with "patent zero" (Randomized? User Based?) <br/>
 spread virus across in all directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) <br/>
 (optional) ignore "immune" values<br/>
 repeat until all values are either infected or immune <br/>

## IMPLIMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
- NECESSARY: Design choice for how patent zero is chosen.
- NECESSARY: Implimentation for method of choosing patent zero
- Design choice for determining world dimensions
- Implimentation for method of determining world dimensions
- Optimization for infection spread loop
- Optimization for calculating number of loops for spreading
- OPTIONAL: reformat program to allow use of non-square world dimensions. (x != y)
