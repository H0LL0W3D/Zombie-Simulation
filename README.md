Simulate zombie "proximity" spread in two dimensional plane made out of arrays.

/*****************************************************/
2d matrix initially constructed
(optional) initialize with specialized "immunity" spots
initialize with "patent zero" (Randomized? User Based?)
spread virus across in all directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
(optional) ignore "immune" values
repeat until all values are either infected or immune

#IMPLIMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

- NECESSARY: Design choice for how patent zero is chosen.
- NECESSARY: Implimentation for method of choosing patent zero
-           Design choice for determining world dimensions
-           Implimentation for method of determining world dimensions
- OPTIONAL:  reformat program to allow use of non-square world dimensions. (x != y)
-           Optimization for infection spread loop
-           Optimization for calculating number of loops for spreading
